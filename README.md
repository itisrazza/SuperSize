**SuperSize** is a utility which maximises your window to multiple displays for maximum work (or play) efficiency. It includes a number of presets to maximise to and it's scriptable with [IronPython] for ultimate adaptability.

## Download

I'm still getting a CI/CD pipeline going. Until that happens, I periodically manually upload a [release]. You can always download and build it from source. If you have VS2019 with .NET installed, you should be up and going fairly quickly.
